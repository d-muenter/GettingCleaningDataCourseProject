The original data was obtained from:
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

The following description is from the quoted site:

### Data Set Information:

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

### Attribute Information:

For each record in the dataset it is provided:
- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope.
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables.
- Its activity label.
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.



## Modifying Procedure

Summary: After downloading the data, the train and test data was combined and ordered by the subject id. The data was then filtered to only include, apart from subject and activity, those features with measurements on mean and standard deviation. Finally, an independent data set was created with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

For a detailed discription of the modifications see the README file.


## Variables

subject  -  the number of the subject
            from the test group: subjects 2, 4, 9, 10, 12, 13, 18, 20, 24
            from the train group: subjects 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19, 21, 22, 23, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 20

activity  -  the type of activity that was recorded
             in the original data they were:
             walking: 1
             walking_upstairs: 2
             walking_downstairs: 3
             sitting: 4
             standing: 5
             laying: 6

the following variables are the averages of each feature with measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each subject and each activity:
